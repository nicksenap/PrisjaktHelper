# Prisjakt Helper Chrome Extension
Prisjakt Helper is a powerful Chrome extension designed to enhance your shopping experience on Prisjakt.nu. It innovatively transforms product listings by generating semi-direct links even for products that initially lack direct links.

Our goal is to provide an unparalleled shopping experience, ensuring that users have unrestricted access to all available offers. This approach not only streamlines your shopping journey, but also aids in making informed purchase decisions by having all the options within easy reach.

## Features
1. Semi-Direct Link Creation: Prisjakt Helper intelligently generates a semi-direct link for every product without an existing direct link on Prisjakt.nu. This ensures you have immediate access to all offers associated with the product.

2. Adaptable Navigation: Prisjakt Helper can identify and redirect you to the appropriate store URL when available, with the product name automatically copied to your clipboard for easy reference. If the store URL cannot be identified, the extension copies both the store name and the product name to your clipboard and redirects you to Google to continue your product search.

3. Effortless Shopping Experience: With all the information just a click away, Prisjakt Helper ensures that your online shopping experience becomes quick, convenient, and enjoyable.
